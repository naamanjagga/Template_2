               <p>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument, but the definition is vague,
                  overlapping with those of a letter, a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally 
                  been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical 
                  organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual 
                  tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of 
                  theme," etc.[1]<br><br>
